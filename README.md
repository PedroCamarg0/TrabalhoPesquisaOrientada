# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Training Schedule Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the training schedules across two branches of the SuperFit gym chain. The primary objective is to minimize the total time required for all clients to complete their workouts, while adhering to operational rules and personalized training plans. The solution is implemented using mathematical programming with the [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) library in Python.

## 📌 Features

- **Personalized Scheduling**: Tailors workout schedules based on individual client plans.
- **Operational Constraints**: Considers gym-specific rules and limitations.
- **Optimization Algorithm**: Utilizes mathematical programming to find optimal solutions.
- **Python Implementation**: Developed using Python with OR-Tools for optimization.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `codigo.py`: Main script containing the optimization logic.
